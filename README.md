There are 4 variables available:

* DATABASE_URL â€” one-line address to the database, for example: sqlite:///db.sqlite3

## Add location

To add locations use python3 manage.py load_place <link> where link is a link to json with a description of the object
```
python3 manage.py load_place https://example.com/path/to/place.json
```
